Pins used for the project

# How to install

Clone the repo  : `git clone https://github.com/roscarobb21/LCD_LIB_8051.git`
<br>
Connect in the same way in MULTISIM or use different pinout
<br>
If you use different pinout, you should modify the pins in `LCD_LIB.c`
<br>
Call the LCD functions in `main.c`
